They were usually worn without socks and were considered suitable attire for the avant-garde man.</p><p id="p_3e390d0d-fb6b-4d50-bae5-bf5ac1fa7742">In the 1980s and 1990s clogs based on Swedish clogs returned in fashion for women. Platform clogs or sandals, often raised as high as 6 or even 8 inches right through between sole and insole, were worn in many western countries. The large mid layer was often made of solid cork, although some were merely of plastic with a cork covering. The sole, more often than not, was made of a light sandy-colored rubber. Some of the platforms of these clogs were encompassed about with a string-laced effect.</p><p id="p_a03353c0-974b-4d93-fe93-7f2800021fc6">In 2007 Dutch designers Viktor &amp; Rolf introduced high heeled Dutch clogs on the catwalk, with their winter collection of 2007/08. In 2010, Swedish clogs for women returned again in Chanel’s and Louis Vuitton’s Spring / Summer 2010 collection.</p></body></topic>
