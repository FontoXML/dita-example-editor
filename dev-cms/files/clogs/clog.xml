Clogs are used worldwide and although the form may vary by culture, within a culture the form often remained unchanged for centuries.</p><p id="p_25977c88-303e-4564-9fe0-d6781bec2e2a">Traditional clogs were often worn in heavy labor. Today they remain in use as protective clothing in agriculture and in some factories and mines. Although clogs are sometimes negatively associated with cheap and folkloric footwear of farmers and the working class, some types of clogs are considered as fashion wear today, such as Swedish Tr√§skor or Japanese geta.</p><p id="p_c5e66d62-c026-4663-a132-8301ed6b067e">Clogs are also used in several different styles of dance. When worn for dancing an important feature is the sound of the clog against the floor. This is one of the fundamental roots of tap, but with the tap shoes the taps are free to click against each other and produce different sound to clogs.</p><fig id="fig_4e4f4541-67df-4637-8181-45c0d5ad1aaa"><title id="title_80ccd6a1-b399-4977-cd5a-6199c28974d4">Clogs from the Netherlands</title><desc id="desc_9433d3ce-6b71-4d2d-c8b1-b20ed7d27ae1"><p id="p_f67376d2-9ad9-416d-ffda-b52b4bfe1fb8">Clogs are often associated with whole foot style klompen from the Netherlands.</p></desc><image href="clogs/Dutchclogs.jpg" id="image_fb188ad3-3210-4e13-9767-f779ba9bd56c"><alt id="alt_f0315ada-f511-4289-f3da-391d19fca643">A picture of typically Dutch wooden shoes, or clogs.</alt></image></fig></body></topic>
